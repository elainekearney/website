abstract: "**Background.** Long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important consideration in planning treatment for individuals with brain tumours. \n
**Aim.** The current study examined relationships between HRQoL and anatomical location of the lesion in patients 6-24 months post-surgery.\n
**Methods.** Following left-hemisphere tumour resection, 37 individuals underwent behavioural testing and MRI. A principal component analysis across 10 HRQoL measures identified two components explaining ~62% of the variance: a communication-related and a mood-related component. Three lesion maps were generated per participant capturing (1) the primary resection, (2) the resection plus residual tumour, oedema, and peri-resection treatment effect (resection+), and (3) residual tumour, oedema, and peri-resection treatment effect alone (residual). Relationships between HRQoL components and lesion maps were examined using voxel-wise lesion symptom-mapping as well as general linear models predicting tract- and voxel-wise disconnection severities.\n
**Results.** Communication-related quality of life was significantly associated with lesions comprising both the resection+ and residual tumour in the left medial inferior parietal lobe. Voxel-wise analyses of white matter disconnection severities revealed significant associations between communication-related quality of life and thalamostriatal fibres for the residual tumour lesions. None of the analyses involving mood-related quality of life or the primary resection lesion maps were significant.\n
**Conclusions.** The findings highlight the role of the residual tumour, oedema, and peri-resection treatment effects and associated white matter disconnection in communication-related quality of life following treatment."
