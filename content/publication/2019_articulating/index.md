abstract: "Speech production is a highly complex sensorimotor task involving tightly coordinated processing
across large expanses of the cerebral cortex. Historically, the study of the neural underpinnings of
speech suffered from the lack of an animal model. The development of non-invasive structural and
functional neuroimaging techniques in the late twentieth century has dramatically improved our
understanding of the speech network. Techniques for measuring regional cerebral blood flow
have illuminated the neural regions involved in various aspects of speech, including feedforward
and feedback control mechanisms. In parallel, we have designed, experimentally tested, and
refined a neural network model detailing the neural computations performed by specific
neuroanatomical regions during speech. Computer simulations of the model account for a wide
range of experimental findings, including data on articulatory kinematics and brain activity
during normal and perturbed speech. Furthermore, the model is being used to investigate a
wide range of communication disorders."
