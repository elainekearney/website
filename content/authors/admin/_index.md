I am a speech scientist interested in the sensorimotor control of speech production. I earned my PhD in speech-language pathology at the University of Toronto (advisor: Dr. Yana Yunusova) and completed postdoctoral training in speech neuroscience at Boston University (advisor: Dr. Frank Guenther). My research program investigates the brain mechanisms underlying acquired motor speech disorders, with the long-term goal of expanding the evidence-based speech therapy options available to those living with neurological disorders.



As of 2022, I am available for scientific consulting, particularly in the areas of experimental design and detailed analysis (acoustic, kinematic, computational modeling) and interpretation of data for studies of speech production.
