For the condition with auditory masking, speech-shaped noise was played via earphones at 90 dB SPL. Responses to the laryngeal perturbation were compared to responses by the same participants to an auditory perturbation experiment that involved a 100-cent downward shift in fundamental frequency (fo). Responses were also examined in relation to a measure of auditory acuity.\n\n**Results:** Compensatory responses to the laryngeal perturbation were observed with and without auditory masking. The level of compensation was greatest in the laryngeal perturbation condition without auditory masking, followed by the condition with auditory masking; the level of compensation was smallest in the auditory perturbation experiment. No relationship was found between the degree of compensation to auditory versus laryngeal perturbations, and the variation in responses in both perturbation experiments was not related to auditory acuity.\n\n**Conclusions:** The findings indicate that somatosensory and auditory feedback control mechanisms work together to compensate for laryngeal perturbations, resulting in the greatest degree of compensation when both sources of feedback are available. In contrast, these two control mechanisms work in competition in response to auditory perturbations, resulting in an overall smaller degree of compensation.","tags":["speech motor control","voice motor control","somatosensory feedback","auditory feedback","sensory acuity"],"title":"Contributions of auditory and somatosensory feedback to vocal motor control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["","","",""],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1582203600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582203600,"objectID":"7cb6dcc6a147c429e4b6427f4316c445","permalink":"/talk/cms_2020/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/cms_2020/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["speech motor control","somatosensory feedback","auditory feedback","sensory acuity"],"title":"Contributions of auditory and somatosensory feedback to vocal motor control","type":"talk"},{"authors":["","","","","","","","","","","",""],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"248483d932d0803fe5a384c8f427e8af","permalink":"/publication/2020_simplediva/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_simplediva/","section":"publication","summary":"Sensorimotor adaptation experiments are commonly used to examine motor learning behavior and to uncover information about the underlying control mechanisms of many motor behaviors, including speech production. In the speech and voice domains, aspects of the acoustic signal are shifted/perturbed over time via auditory feedback manipulations. In response, speakers alter their production in the opposite direction of the shift so that their perceived production is closer to what they intended. This process relies on a combination of feedback and feedforward control mechanisms that are difficult to disentangle. The current study describes and tests a simple 3-parameter mathematical model that quantifies the relative contribution of feedback and feedforward control mechanisms to sensorimotor adaptation. The model is a simplified version of the DIVA model, an adaptive neural network model of speech motor control. The three fitting parameters of SimpleDIVA are associated with the three key subsystems involved in speech motor control, namely auditory feedback control, somatosensory feedback control, and feedforward control. The model is tested through computer simulations that identify optimal model fits to six existing sensorimotor adaptation datasets. We show its utility in (1) interpreting the results of adaptation experiments involving the first and second formant frequencies as well as fundamental frequency; (2) assessing the effects of masking noise in adaptation paradigms; (3) fitting more than one perturbation dimension simultaneously; (4) examining sensorimotor adaptation at different timepoints in the production signal; and (5) quantitatively predicting responses in one experiment using parameters derived from another experiment. The model simulations produce excellent fits to real data across different types of perturbations and experimental paradigms (mean correlation between data and model fits across all six studies = .95 ± .02). The model parameters provide a mechanistic explanation for the behavioral responses to the adaptation paradigm that are not readily available from the behavioral responses alone. Overall, SimpleDIVA offers new insights into speech and voice motor control and has the potential to inform future directions of speech rehabilitation research in disordered populations. Simulation software, including an easy-to-use graphical user interface, is publicly available to facilitate the use of the model in future studies.","tags":["speech motor control","voice motor control","auditory feedback","computational modeling","sensorimotor adaptation"],"title":"A simple 3-parameter model for examining adaptation in speech and voice production","type":"publication"},{"authors":["",""],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"297e7b2e2ac6598f7a5b8ff7a34e753c","permalink":"/publication/2019_articulating/","publishdate":"2019-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_articulating/","section":"publication","summary":"Speech production is a highly complex sensorimotor task involving tightly coordinated processing across large expanses of the cerebral cortex. Historically, the study of the neural underpinnings of speech suffered from the lack of an animal model. The development of non-invasive structural and functional neuroimaging techniques in the late twentieth century has dramatically improved our understanding of the speech network. Techniques for measuring regional cerebral blood flow have illuminated the neural regions involved in various aspects of speech, including feedforward and feedback control mechanisms. In parallel, we have designed, experimentally tested, and refined a neural network model detailing the neural computations performed by specific neuroanatomical regions during speech. Computer simulations of the model account for a wide range of experimental findings, including data on articulatory kinematics and brain activity during normal and perturbed speech. Furthermore, the model is being used to investigate a wide range of communication disorders.","tags":["articulation","speech motor control","neuroimaging","DIVA model"],"title":"Articulating: The neural mechanisms of speech production","type":"publication"},{"authors":["","","",""],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1566392400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566392400,"objectID":"16001bd884cf260e409bf77b09e45f09","permalink":"/talk/snl_2019/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/snl_2019/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["sensorimotor adpatation","DIVA model","computational modeling","speech motor control"],"title":"SimpleDIVA: A 3-parameter model for examining adaptation in speech and voice production","type":"talk"},{"authors":["","","","",""],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1564876800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564876800,"objectID":"e4aafa04123b9de2ff4184d739d7396b","permalink":"/publication/2019_ema_biofeedback/","publishdate":"2019-08-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_ema_biofeedback/","section":"publication","summary":"The application of state-of-the-art signal processing often differs between offline and online real-time application domains. Offline processing techniques may be used to accurately reduce signal noise and spot errors before analysis. However, without the global signal information available to offline processes, such techniques can be difficult to reproduce in online real-time applications. This paper presented methods that were developed to support a state-of-the-art computer-based speech therapy system. These methods included online head correction and low-pass filtering and aimed to reproduce offline processing data quality when using a real-time clinical feedback application. The adequacy of these methods was evaluated relative to the offline processing ‘gold’ standard and in a context of computing a specific kinematic parameter (i.e. articulatory working space). The results showed that the online real-time output values were highly correlated with the offline manually-processed values.","tags":["augmented visual feedback","kinematics","signal processing"],"title":"Electromagnetic articulography (EMA) for real-time feedback application: Computational techniques","type":"publication"},{"authors":["","","",""],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"ee1417a378e6eeac249f8ac69dc721df","permalink":"/publication/2019_aos_kinematics/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_aos_kinematics/","section":"publication","summary":"**Background**: Apraxia of speech (AOS) is defined as a disorder of articulatory movements, yet a cohesive account of the movement deficit in AOS appears to be lacking. Kinematic evaluation yields precise and objective information regarding the movement deficit in AOS; however, it is an underutilised technique in AOS assessment and in the planning and delivery of treatment. Clearly defined kinematic features of AOS can potentially play a central role in the identification of treatment targets and in measuring treatment outcomes in AOS.\n\n**Aims**: The overall goal of this systematic review was to characterise the state of the science pertaining to kinematic features of acquired AOS. Specifically, we aimed to (1) characterise kinematic features that distinguish speech in AOS from healthy controls, and (2) determine how these features may vary as a function of task complexity and speaking condition. Five electronic databases were searched from their start-date up to July 2017 using the key terms AOS and speech kinematics. Two raters independently screened abstracts and full texts for inclusion based on pre-determined criteria. Data regarding participant demographics, study design, methods, and results were extracted and analysed descriptively. Two independent raters used a modified version of the Critical Appraisal Tool for Cross-Sectional Studies (AXIS) to assess the methodological quality of included studies.\n\n**Main Contribution**: The review yielded a total of 11 studies, including 10 case-control studies and one case study. The results revealed a lack of high-quality literature reporting on the kinematic features of AOS. In broad terms, the small body of existing literature reported increased movement range and duration of the lips, jaw, and tongue, increased movement variability, the presence of silent articulatory attempts, and the influence of increasing stimulus complexity on articulatory precision/execution. While initial studies have been helpful in demonstrating the potential of kinematic evaluation in AOS, future studies with higher-quality methodology and larger sample sizes are needed to better characterise movement-based impairments related to AOS and to facilitate potential clinical applications.\n\n**Conclusions**: Movement-based evaluation provides a promising avenue for the assessment and treatment of AOS, including potential target-selection and measurement of treatment outcomes.","tags":["apraxia of speech","systematic review","kinematics"],"title":"Towards movement-based outcome measures for apraxia of speech: A systematic review","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Two independent raters screened the abstracts and full articles for inclusion. Relevant data were extracted and summarized, and methodological quality of accepted articles was assessed.\n\n**Results**: Eight single-group studies and 10 randomized control trials were included in the review. Augmented visual feedback-based treatments resulted in improved outcomes with small to large effect sizes post-treatment for the majority of impairment, activity, participation, and global motor function measures, and these improvements were often superior to traditional rehabilitation/education programs. Enhanced treatment outcomes were observed in studies that provided large amounts and high intensities of treatment; gamified feedback; and provided knowledge of performance feedback in real-time on 100% of practice trials.\n\n**Conclusion**: Augmented visual feedback appears to be a useful motor rehabilitation tool in Parkinson's disease; however, high-quality, rigorous studies remain limited. Future studies should consider factors that enhance rehabilitation outcomes when designing augmented visual feedback-based interventions. Implications for rehabilitation Augmented visual feedback is a useful tool for motor rehabilitation in Parkinson's disease; augmented visual feedback-based treatments are often superior to traditional programs. These treatments are associated with improved outcomes in impairment, activity, participation, and global motor function domains. Rehabilitation professionals can optimize their use of augmented visual feedback-based treatments by providing large amounts and a high intensity of treatment, gamifying feedback, and providing knowledge of performance feedback in real-time and at a high frequency.","tags":["Parkinson's disease","augmented visual feedback","outcome measures","systematic review"],"title":"Augmented visual feedback-aided interventions for motor rehabilitation in Parkinson's disease: A systematic review","type":"publication"},{"authors":[""],"categories":[],"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image(\u0026#39;https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#34;Welcome to Academic!\u0026#34;) Welcome to Academic!

The treatment aimed to increase tongue movement size using a combination of a verbal cue and augmented visual feedback and was conducted in 10 45-min sessions over 5 weeks. The presence of visual feedback was manipulated during treatment. Articulatory working space of the tongue was the primary outcome measure and was examined during treatment and in cued and uncued sentences pre- and posttreatment. Changes in speech intelligibility in response to a verbal cue pre- and posttreatment were also examined.\n\n**Results**: During treatment, 4/5 participants showed a beneficial effect of visual feedback on tongue articulatory working space. At the end of the treatment, they used larger tongue movements when cued, relative to their pretreatment performance. None of the participants, however, generalized the effect to the uncued sentences. Speech intelligibility of cued sentences was judged as superior posttreatment only in a single participant.\n\n**Conclusions**: This study demonstrated that using an augmented visual feedback approach is beneficial, beyond a verbal cue alone, in addressing articulatory hypokinesia in individuals with PD. An optimal degree of articulatory expansion might, however, be required to elicit a speech intelligibility benefit.","tags":["Parkinson's disease","augmented visual feedback","kinematics","speech intelligibility"],"title":"Treating speech movement hypokinesia in Parkinson's disease: Does movement size matter?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["","","","","",""],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1513728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1513728000,"objectID":"bfcf78d4368b4c35055eaa953c74b4c3","permalink":"/publication/2017_pd_kinematics/","publishdate":"2017-12-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017_pd_kinematics/","section":"publication","summary":"**Purpose**: To further understand the effect of Parkinson's disease (PD) on articulatory movements in speech and to expand our knowledge of therapeutic treatment strategies, this study examined movements of the jaw, tongue blade, and tongue dorsum during sentence production with respect to speech intelligibility and compared the effect of varying speaking styles on these articulatory movements.\n\n**Method**: Twenty-one speakers with PD and 20 healthy controls produced 3 sentences under normal, loud, clear, and slow speaking conditions. Speech intelligibility was rated for each speaker. A 3-dimensional electromagnetic articulograph tracked movements of the articulators. Measures included articulatory working spaces, ranges along the first principal component, average speeds, and sentence durations.\n\n**Results**: Speakers with PD demonstrated significantly smaller jaw movements as well as shorter than normal sentence durations. Between-speaker variation in movement size of the jaw, tongue blade, and tongue dorsum was associated with speech intelligibility. Analysis of speaking conditions revealed similar patterns of change in movement measures across groups and articulators: larger than normal movement sizes and faster speeds for loud speech, increased movement sizes for clear speech, and larger than normal movement sizes and slower speeds for slow speech.\n\n**Conclusions**: Sentence-level measures of articulatory movements are sensitive to both disease-related changes in PD and speaking-style manipulations.","tags":["Parkinson's disease","cueing","kinematics","speech intelligibility"],"title":"Sentence-level movements in Parkinson's disease: Loud, clear, and slow speech","type":"publication"},{"authors":["","","","","",""],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1498089600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498089600,"objectID":"a5fc3313172959ade55ea6cd4c09e886","permalink":"/publication/2017_pd_motorlearning/","publishdate":"2017-06-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017_pd_motorlearning/","section":"publication","summary":"**Purpose**: The purpose of this pilot study was to demonstrate the effect of augmented visual feedback on acquisition and short-term retention of a relatively simple instruction to increase movement amplitude during speaking tasks in patients with dysarthria due to Parkinson's disease (PD).\n\n**Method**: Nine patients diagnosed with PD, hypokinetic dysarthria, and impaired speech intelligibility participated in a training program aimed at increasing the size of their articulatory (tongue) movements during sentences.

Seven databases were searched to identify studies reporting outcomes of treatment in SSDs between 1985 and 2014. Sixty-six studies were identified for analysis, and reported outcome measures were categorized within the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health framework (ICF-CY). The majority of studies used perceptual methods (despite their limitations) to evaluate change at the impairment level of the ICF-CY and only three studies examined participation level factors. Accurate outcome measures that reflect the underlying deficit of the SSD as well as activity/participation level factors need to be implemented to document intervention success in this population.","tags":["speech sound disorder","motor speech","children","speech therapy","outcome measures"],"title":"Outcome measures in developmental speech sound disorders with a motor basis","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":" R Markdown This is an R Markdown document.

The results showed that none of the typical children had complete contact across the palate during any of the vowels. However, of the 119 vowels produced by the children with SSD, 24% showed complete contact across the palate during at least a portion of the vowel segment. The results from the typically-developing children suggest that complete tongue-palate contact is an atypical articulatory feature. However, the evidence suggests that this pattern occurs relatively frequently in children with SSD. Further research is needed to determine the prevalence, cause, and perceptual consequence of complete tongue-palate contact.","tags":["vowel production","children","speech sound disorder","electropalatography"],"title":"Tongue–palate contact during selected vowels in children with speech sound disorders","type":"publication"}]
